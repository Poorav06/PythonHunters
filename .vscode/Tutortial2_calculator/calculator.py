# We will be learning few conversation of datatypes

# 1) str to int : any string that is has a number or integer can be converted to int or float type 
#     int("45") OR int("45.5")
# 2) int to str : any number can be converted to a string 
#     str(54) 


a= "45"
b= ""
print(type(int(a)))

# We will learn about breaking a string

command = input("Enter your equation :")
print(command)

# you will be able to see the equation as is but here we want to convert the equation into math 
# for doing the same we will have to break down the string into parts and then convert 

# We will also learn about list

l=[ 1, 2, 3]
print(sum(l))
