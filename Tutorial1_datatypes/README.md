### Variables and data types

A Python variable is a reserved memory location to store values. In other words, a variable in a python program gives data to the computer for processing. Every value in Python has a datatype. Different data types in Python are Numbers, List, Tuple, Strings, Dictionary, etc. Variables can be declared by any name or even alphabets like a, aa, abc, etc

#### Variable Naming Rules in Python 

1 Variable name should start with letter(a-zA-Z) or underscore (_). Valid: age, _age, Age Invalid : 1age 2.In variable name, no special characters allowed other than underscore (_). Valid : age_ , _age
Invalid : age_*
3.Variables are case sensitive.
age and Age are different, since variable names are case sensitive. 4.Variable name can have numbers but not at the beginning.
Example: Age1
5.Variable name should not be a Python keyword.Keywords are also called as reserved words.
Example
pass, break, continue.. etc are reserved for special meaning in Python. So, we should not declare keyword as a variable name.

#### Data types in Python 

Data types are the classification or categorization of data items. It represents the kind of value that tells what operations can be performed on a particular data. Since everything is an object in Python programming, data types are actually classes and variables are instance (object) of these classes.

Following are the standard or built-in data type of Python:

1) Numeric: int & float
2) Sequence Type: str
3) Boolean: bool
